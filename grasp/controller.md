### Controller
The `Controller` principle is designed to solve the problem of separating the interface and logic in an interactive application.
This is nothing more than a well-known controller from the [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) pattern. 
The controller is responsible for processing requests and decides to whom to delegate requests for execution.

Controllers are used in AngularJS, Spring MVC, etc.
